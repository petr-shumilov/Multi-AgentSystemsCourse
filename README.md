# Multi-Agent Systems Course
## Task 1
Let we have an undirected connected graph. Each node contains the integer value.<br>
**Required:** develop a system of agents based on the above graph and able to compute the arithmetic mean of all nodes values.
 
 ## Task 2
Let we have such as the above graph. Additionally we have two side effects: break connection and delay with some probability.<br>
 **Required:** develop a system of agents based on the above graph and able to compute the arithmetic mean of all nodes values using method of local agreement.
